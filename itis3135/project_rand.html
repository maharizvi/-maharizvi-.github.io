    <h2>Project Assignment 1</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li>
                The application for this project will be for a small business for photography called Maha's Photos.
                This business is owned and operated by me and my brother, Yousuf Rizvi. For the model of the project,
                I will be developing the website, and my brother will hold the role of the client. The business currently
                solely relies on its Instagram page to display a photography portfolio and communicate with potential clients.
                While Instagram works well to display photos, the client is looking for a website to display different packages
                for photography options and have all their information listed to make it easy for potential photography clients
                to locate.
            </li>
            <li>
                The intended users of the website include the client, potential photography clients that are interested
                in browsing through different photo packages, and current photography clients that can use the website as a
                reference to go back to find information about the business. 
            </li>
            <li>
                To begin with, the contents of the website will be aimed to include: a list of all the photography packages the client offers,
                prices, descriptions of what is included in each package, images that reflect each package, and a contact form for potential clients
                to input their information if they are interested in booking a session.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Dynamic Functionality</h4>
    <p>
        The dynamic functionality within this site will fall most heavily within the page 
        for clients to book their session. This page requires a form functionality for potential clients to 
        input their information and select which type of package they are booking for their session.
        Example of a page we constructed for an earlier activity with a form:
    </p>
