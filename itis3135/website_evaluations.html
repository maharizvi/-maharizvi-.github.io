			<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/home">My Favorite Website</a></h3>

			<p>Linked above is the website for Twitter for desktop. I honestly really like this website and prefer it to the app on my phone.
                There is a consistent theme, excellent layout, and all the functions I need from the site are easy to locate and to use. Most of the
                functions are located on the left side of the main screen, on accessible and clear buttons. The main feed is located in the middle of
                the screen which refreshes in real time, and trending topics appear on the right hand of the screen, with ample space
                for all parts to fit properly.
            </p>

			<ul>
				<li>Contrast - The website has the ability to be in dark or light mode according to user preference. Each mode contrasts its font and background accordingly and keeps each element easy to see and use.</li>
				<li>Repetition- Repetition is very apparent throughout's Twitter website design. There is complete uniformity across all fonts, a solid color scheme, and use of space across the site.</li>
				<li>Alignment - As a user, I really enjoy the alignment of all the functions, feed, and trending topics on one screen on the website, whereas on the app, these would all be on different tabs, making it inconvenient to get a holistic view of all your information.</li>
				<li>Proximity - The way all the elements are spread out and the distance from each are excellent, nothing is too crowded or overbearing, giving it the perfect website experience.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><a href="https://www.geni.com/">My Most Hated Website of All Time</a></h3>

			<p>Geni is a website where you are able to connect to your family tree and discover your lineage, as well as keep in touch with current family members. 
                While it was more popular around 2007, for some reason I still have family members that are avid users of this website to remember birthdays and keep
                up with each other. I still receive emails and notifications from this website, but absolutely despise its layout and design. It feels like they have not updated it
                since 2007 and it is difficult to use properly.
            </p>

			<ul>
				<li>Contrast - It appears the website is trying to follow a color scheme, but for the contrast there are certain portions within the page in which the background colors make it harder to locate specific titles. The gray font does not work well with the other colors.</li>
				<li>Repetition - There are certain headings that are bolded that don't necessarily need to be and vice versa that disrupt its attempt at repetition.</li>
				<li>Alignment - Personally, I find the alignmenet of the elements within this site to be all over the place and inconsistent. It makes it very difficult to locate functions.</li>
				<li>Proximity - I am also not a fan of how elements are spaced throughout the site. Some elements are too close together, causing crowding and disruption in the user experience.</li>
			</ul>
