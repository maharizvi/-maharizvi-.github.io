    <h2>About Us!</h2> 
    <p>The Maha's Photos team consists of Maha Rizvi, the photographer, and her brother, 
        Yousuf Rizvi, the editing and retouching expert. This brother-sister business began in 
        2018 when Maha began to take her hobby on a venture as a small business. Yousuf came to learn 
        more about photo retouching and editing to help Maha focus on her photoshoots. With workshops and courses 
        to train, both siblings perfected their craft and love to work together to bring you the best 
        photos from your session!
